# OBD2-pi

Hello, this is my first python project so be nice :), i started coding this about 2 months ago as i have always had an interest in python.

Paypal Donations are more then welcome to keep this project going: paypal.me/coopers10345

This program is made with python3 and tkinter and is an interactive obd2 infometer for all cars that support obd2, you are able to view speed,rpm,temps and all obd2 sensors with this program you are also able to read and clear DTC's.
Works with ELM327 Bluetooth and USB

########################

If anyone has any suggestions on how to make this program look nicer and more effecient please please let me know or even help me and teach me :)

########################

Things i need to fix:
- Listbox in sensor window does not show all sensors as it needs a scrollbar (wanted to make it auto refresh every x seconds but the scrollbar kept going to top)
- Scan.serial sometimes didnt find my ELM327 usb then switched over to bluetooth version and never had a problem.

########################

To Run simply do python3 scan.py
